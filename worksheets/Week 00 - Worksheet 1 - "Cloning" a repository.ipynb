    "While it may be tempting or convenient to think of this as _downloading_ something, that's not quite what \"cloning\" is. More accurately, a `clone` operation creates a _copy_ or _version_ of the group of files in a [repository](../README.md#\"Repositories\").\n",

    "3. In the resulting popover, click the `Use SSH` link option\n",
    "  * This allows us to `clone` these files using your SSH key\n",

    "5. In your terminal, be sure that you're in your home directory (`~`)\n",
    "  * If unsure, type `cd` or `cd ~` and press `Enter`\n",
    "  * Check where you are by typing `pwd` and pressing `Enter`\n",
    "  * If the result looks like `/home/YOUR GITHUB USERNAME`, you're in the right place\n",
