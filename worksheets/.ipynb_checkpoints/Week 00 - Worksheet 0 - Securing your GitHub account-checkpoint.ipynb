    "This may seem like an extra step -- and it is. But, it's an important one. Completing this activity will allow you to retrieve course content in a more secure way than logging into GitHub _and_ will streamline the process of working with repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Big promises, but -- trust me -- they're true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have some familiarity with a terminal, I'm going outsource explaining how to generate a key to...myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "Click the image below to watch a short video about creating SSH keys. There's an activity in the video that you can follow to generate your own key on this server (in your terminal).\n",
    "\n",
    "A step-by-step outline follows the video, if you're into the tl;dr.\n",
    "\n",
    "(But watch the video; it appeals to my vanity.)\n",

    "1. Open a [terminal](../README.md#Using-our-terminal)\n",
    "2. At the prompt, type (or copy and paste): `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"YOUR ALLEGHENY EMAIL\"`\n",
    "3. When asked for a location at which to save the key, leave it blank to accept the default value and press `Enter`\n",
    "4. Provide a password for the key when the system asks\n",
    "  * When typing characters at the prompt, no text will appear -- this is normal\n",
    "  * `ssh-keygen` will request your password twice to ensure you've got it right\n",
    "\n",
    "Your key files (private/public) live at the following location: `~/.ssh/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding your key to GitHub\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the terminal, type (or copy and paste): `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`\n",
    "  * This should print something that looks like gibberish to your screen\n",
    "2. Copy the output starting at `ssh-rsa` to the end (your Allegheny email address)\n",
    "3. Head over to [GitHub](https://www.github.com)\n",
    "4. Locate and click your profile picture in the upper right corner of the screen\n",
    "5. Select `Settings` from the resulting menu\n",
    "6. On the next page, locate and click the `SSH and GPG keys` menu item\n",
    "7. Click the `New SSH key` button (it's green)\n",
    "8. Title your key something descriptive\n",
    "  * I'll offer: `Allegheny CS JupyterLab`\n",
    "  * Copy and paste that, if you like\n",
    "9. Paste the gibberish in the `Key Field`"
